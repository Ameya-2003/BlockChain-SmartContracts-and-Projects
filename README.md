üéâ **Welcome to my Blockchain-Ethereum Repository!**

This repository showcases my projects exploring blockchain technology and Solidity programming. Each project demonstrates my understanding of various aspects of blockchain 
development, including: Smart Contract development and Ethereum Development

üìù **Projects**

**1. The BlockChain Messenger** 

The objective of this project is to Save the message on the blockchain, readable (public) to everyone, writable (private) to the person who deployed the contract and
Count how many times the message was updated.

**2. Tokenization of Assets(Currencies)**

This project explores the concept of tokenizing real-world assets (such as currencies) on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It implements the ERC-20 standard to create fungible tokens representing ownership of the underlying asset.
